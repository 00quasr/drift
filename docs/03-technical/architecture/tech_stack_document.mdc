# Tech Stack Document for Drift

This document explains the technologies chosen for Drift in everyday language. It shows how each part of the stack helps us build a fast, reliable, and user-friendly platform for discovering and rating venues, events, and artists.

## 1. Frontend Technologies

Our frontend is everything the user sees and interacts with in their browser or on mobile. We chose tools that make it easy to build a beautiful, responsive, and accessible interface:

- **React**  
  A popular library for building user interfaces with reusable pieces called components. It helps us manage state (data) and update the screen quickly.

- **shadcn/ui (Tailwind-based component system)**  
  A set of pre-styled UI components built on Tailwind CSS. It speeds up design work while maintaining a clean, consistent look.

- **Tailwind CSS**  
  A utility-first styling framework that lets us write CSS classes directly in our HTML/JSX. This approach keeps styles predictable, small, and easy to maintain.

- **Radix UI**  
  Under the hood of shadcn/ui, Radix components ensure our interface is accessible (keyboard-friendly, screen-reader ready) without extra effort.

- **Framer Motion**  
  A library for smooth, physics-based animations and micro-interactions (hover effects, page transitions) that make the app feel premium and playful.

- **Vite or Next.js**  
  We’ll choose between:
  - **Vite** for a lightning-fast development experience with simple static sites.
  - **Next.js** for production-ready features like server-side rendering (fast first load), file-based routing, and built-in optimizations.

Together, these tools give us a modern, mobile-first, dark-themed interface with minimal chrome, large imagery, and smooth animations.

## 2. Backend Technologies

Our backend handles data storage, authentication, real-time updates, and business logic. We focused on an all-in-one solution that scales easily:

- **Supabase**  
  An open-source Firebase alternative that bundles:
  - **PostgreSQL database** for storing users, venues, events, artists, ratings, comments, and admin logs.
  - **Auth** for secure sign-up, login, and role-based access control (regular users vs. verified creators vs. admins).
  - **Storage** for uploading images (flyers, venue photos, press kits).
  - **Realtime** subscriptions for live updates (new reviews, notifications).

- **pgvector (optional)**  
  An extension for PostgreSQL that lets us store and search vector embeddings. In the future, we can use it for AI-powered recommendations or semantic search.

- **Supabase Functions**  
  Serverless functions for custom backend logic (e.g., sending emails, processing moderation workflows). They run close to our database without managing servers.

- **FastAPI (optional self-hosted)**  
  If we decide to move off Supabase’s managed platform later, we can build a Python-based REST API with FastAPI, connecting to Neon Postgres or another Postgres instance.

## 3. Infrastructure and Deployment

Ensuring Drift is reliable, easy to update, and scalable relies on our infrastructure choices:

- **Version Control with Git & GitHub**  
  All code lives in Git repositories, enabling collaboration, code review, and history tracking.

- **CI/CD with GitHub Actions**  
  Every code change triggers automated tests and builds. Successful builds deploy to our staging or production environments without manual steps.

- **Hosting Platforms**  
  - **Front-end**: Deployed on Vercel (ideal for Next.js) or Netlify (great for Vite), providing global CDN, automatic SSL, and instant cache invalidation.
  - **Back-end**: Supabase’s managed services host our database, auth, storage, and functions. For self-hosted later, we’ll consider **Neon Postgres** for a scalable, serverless Postgres solution.

- **Domain & SSL**  
  Custom domains with free HTTPS certificates ensure secure connections for users everywhere.

This setup gives us fast global performance, easy rollbacks, and zero-downtime updates.

## 4. Third-Party Integrations

To extend Drift’s functionality without reinventing the wheel, we integrate several services:

- **OpenAI content filtering**  
  Automatically scans user comments for toxicity and spam, quarantining suspect feedback before it goes live.

- **Langchain / OpenRouter (optional)**  
  A wrapper around AI APIs to combine multiple moderation rules or switch providers seamlessly.

- **Mapbox**  
  Interactive maps for venue pages, showing precise locations with customizable styling that matches our dark theme.

- **Email Service (e.g., SendGrid via Supabase SMTP)**  
  Sends account confirmations, whitelist notifications, and review updates.

- **Future Add-Ons**:
  - **Spotify & SoundCloud embeds** on artist and event pages.
  - **Ticketing platform links** (external) and eventual direct checkout integrations.
  - **Analytics tools** for tracking user engagement (e.g., Google Analytics or a privacy-focused alternative).

These integrations boost user engagement, streamline moderation, and prepare us for future growth.

## 5. Security and Performance Considerations

We build Drift with both user safety and speed in mind:

Security Measures

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
  Only verified creators (club owners, promoters, artists) can add or edit listings. Admins manage whitelisting and moderation.

- **Row-Level Security (PostgreSQL Policies)**  
  Ensures users can only access or modify the data they’re allowed to see.

- **Secure Authentication**  
  Password hashing, email confirmations, and optional social logins via Supabase Auth.

- **Content Moderation Workflow**  
  Two-tiered system: AI filters + user flagging → admin review queue → audit logs for compliance.

- **Data Encryption**  
  All data is encrypted at rest (Supabase) and in transit (HTTPS/TLS).

Performance Optimizations

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) & Static Generation**  
  Using Next.js, pages load faster for first-time visitors and improve SEO.

- **Code Splitting & Lazy Loading**  
  Loads only the code and assets needed for each page, reducing initial bundle sizes.

- **Global CDN**  
  Static assets and images (from Supabase Storage) served from edge locations near users.

- **Realtime Subscriptions**  
  Supabase Realtime for live updates without full page refreshes, keeping interactions snappy.

- **Efficient CSS**  
  Tailwind’s utility-based approach generates only the styles we use, keeping CSS footprints small.

## 6. Conclusion and Overall Tech Stack Summary

Drift’s tech stack balances speed, scalability, and ease of development while delivering a polished experience for electronic music fans, promoters, and artists:

- Frontend: React + Tailwind (shadcn/ui, Radix UI) + Framer Motion + Vite/Next.js
- Backend: Supabase (Postgres, Auth, Storage, Realtime, Functions) with pgvector for AI growth and FastAPI as an option
- Infrastructure: GitHub + GitHub Actions + Vercel/Netlify + Supabase/Neon Postgres
- Integrations: OpenAI filtering, Langchain/OpenRouter, Mapbox, Email service, plus planned Spotify/SoundCloud and ticketing
- Security & Performance: RBAC, row-level security, AI moderation, SSR, CDN, lazy loading

Each technology was chosen to support core features—secure accounts, entity interlinking, rich search & filtering, dynamic pages, and a robust moderation system—while ensuring future-proof growth. This stack lets us focus on building a standout platform for discovering and celebrating the global underground music scene.# Tech Stack Document for Drift
